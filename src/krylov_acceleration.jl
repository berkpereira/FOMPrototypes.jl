Compute the Krylov accelerant candidate, write to result_vec.

This function performs an accelerated update of the candidate solution vector by:
    1. Evaluating the operator on an initial column vector from the workspace.
    2. Computing the residual in the Krylov subspace from the difference between the evaluated result and the reference vector.
    3. Solving a least squares problem based on a (possibly shifted) Hessenberg matrix derived from the workspace.
    4. Constructing a full-dimensional approximate solution using the Krylov basis, and re-applying the operator it to obtain the acceleration candidate.

# Parameters besides working vectors
- ws::KrylovWorkspace: 
        The workspace containing the Krylov subspace information, including the Hessenberg matrix, 
        Krylov basis, and other variables required for the computation.
- result_vec::Vector{Float64}: 
        Vector where the computed accelerated candidate solution will be stored.

# Returns
- Nothing. The function updates `result_vec` with the computed acceleration candidate.
