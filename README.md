Prototype first-order methods (FOMs) for convex quadratic programs (QPs) with a novel safeguarded Krylov subspace acceleration method which is described in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06323). The underlying FOMs are instances of the preconditioned proximal point method with differing preconditioner choices leading to ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) and PDHG (primal-dual hybrid gradient), as well as variants requiring only factorisation of diagonal matrices ("factorisation-free").
